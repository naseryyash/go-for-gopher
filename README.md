# go-for-gopher  
(pun intended :)
Project is aimed at teaching intermediate level Go to learners  

It contains some of the advanced syntax, constructs, libraries & concepts in Go. Each of these concepts have been grouped into their respective folders.  
These folders are labelled as per the concepts they cover.  

Essentially each of these folders is a separately runnable GO project. I have just combined them all together to sort of create a cohesive learning experience where you'll get everything in a single project.  
The following concepts are covered in here.  

1) Structs  
2) Pointers  
3) Maps  
4) Http calls with Go  
5) Interfaces  
6) Routines and Channels  
7) File handling  

Hope this project is helpful to all of you learners out there and that it makes learning Go fun !!
